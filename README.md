# CascadeNet: Cascade Network for Multi-view 3D Object Detection

Repository for our arxiv paper ["CascadeNet: Cascade Network for Multi-view 3D Object Detection"](xxx).

## Introduction
We propose CascadeNet with multi-cameras inputs, to infer the object location from a cascade network. It generates the location from three stages, and narrows the location range of each stage by the prediction from the previous stage. The DD3D pretrained VoVNet (V2-99) is adopted as the backbone network.
